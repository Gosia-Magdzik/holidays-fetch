# API Data Integration

I crafted this simple web application as a personal exercise to reinforce my skills in working with Promises and fetching data from APIs. Through hands-on implementation, I walked through the basics of structuring API requests, managing responses, and handling data within React components. The added touch of TypeScript enhances the overall development experience, making this a valuable practice endeavor.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
